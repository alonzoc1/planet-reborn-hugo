{{< notice question >}}
Why did we make Planet Reborn?
{{< /notice >}}

We wanted to create this game, because we wanted to make a game that's similar to Risk of Rain, but with our own spin to it.
In addition, our development team particularly enjoys Roguelike games.
Therefore, we set upon creating Planet Reborn as a sci-fi roguelike game.
We're not entirely sure why we titled our game, Planet Reborn; however, we thought it was a cool game title.
As for the story, we decided to leave that up to the player's interpretation.
We think our game is unique, because it will eventually include procedural level generation, multiple character skills, and a unique story full of mystery.
We also want to make the game as replayable as possible without it being very linear.
On top of that, the combat space and the environments will vary as we didn't want to make the player feel bored with the same theme.

Insert more stuff below.
