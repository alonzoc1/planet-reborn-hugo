{{< notice question >}}
Why did we make Planet Reborn?
{{< /notice >}}
We wanted to create this game, because we wanted to make a game that's similar to Risk of Rain, but with our own spin to it.
In addition, our development team particularly enjoys Roguelike games.
Therefore, we set upon creating Planet Reborn as a sci-fi roguelike game.
We titled our game Planet Reborn to represent our philosophy of what today's games should be like: a simple free game that does not try to insert any microtransactions or pay-to-win elements and instead simply focuses on delivering a good game.
As for the story, we decided to leave that up to the player's interpretation.
